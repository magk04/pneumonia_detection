Pneumonia is a lung infection that happens when an infection causes the air sacs in the lungs to fill with fluid and makes it hard to breathe in enough oxygen to reach the bloodstream. The early diagnosis of pneumonia thus becomes vital. This paper aims to detect bacterial and viral pneumonia using the dataset of 5232 chest x-ray images consisting of bacterial, viral and normal chest x-rays. Few CNN models were used to classify these images into normal, bacterial and viral pneumonia and showed good precision and recall. Therefore, this study can be further extended for fast detection of pneumonia in various places.
